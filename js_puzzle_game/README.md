# notes

This is an attempt at a puzzle game, built with Jquery.

This time, the idea is mostly original, and I believe that much is already clear in how bad the game looks (both aesthetically and in how the code isn't the cleanest thing around).

The game itself, ignoring the visuals, is not all that easy to actually play, specially if you were to uncomment the green options; the idea itself should be something workable if I bother to actually design a level with it rather than leaving the puzzle up to pure chance. Alas, that's not what this exercize was about to begin with. If I ever get more deep into game design, I might revisit this project, however.
