# frontend-practice

Since I'm just starting out, I'm mostly just looking up tutorials on websites such as youtube for the apps I make, then iterating on that with whatever
tech I'm trying to learn at the moment; I'm not looking to make the finished app better than what the original was, only to explore how different techs
approach basically the same problem, what each of them can and can't accomplish.
