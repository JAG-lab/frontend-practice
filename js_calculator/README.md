This is a calculator app on browser built on HTML and CSS with functionality built on JQuery and Javascript.

The original code for this app I got from WebDevSimplified's Vanilla Javascript Calculator, available here: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator

The changes to the script.js and index.html files were mostly done as an exercize in JQuery (as well as math), while the changes to styles.css were just a bit of exploration of the new properties I learned about while following WebDevSimplified's video.
