# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My own notes

While this project was once again started by following WebDevSimplified's tutorial on it (Github link here: <https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/react-calculator> ), I mostly tried to grab my own implementation of my previous js_calculator and attempting to recreate the same app with React. I'm not quite satisfied with it's current state but I need to get a break at some point, and this will be it for today.
