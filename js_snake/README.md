This is a snake game recreated with html, css, javascript and Jquery

The original code for this app I got once again from WebDevSimplified, this time their Javascript Snake Game, available here: <https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Javascript-Snake-Game>

I'm still practicing with Jquery, though admitedly most of the original code didn't have many places where Jquery could simplify anything; I thus improvised with my own additions.

In the process I had to learn quite a bit about css flex and all it's intricacies, which hopefully will become useful in the future.
