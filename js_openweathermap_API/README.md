# notes

This is a weather checking app built with bootstrap, Jquery AJAX and the OpenWeatherMap API

The original code for this app came from lesPatron in GitHub, link here: <https://github.com/lesPatron/Weather-api>

It's not one of my best looking apps, but the purpose this time was to touch on both AJAX and Bootstrap, both things that I hadn't before had a chance to try out.

I will continue to practice with APIs in the near future.
